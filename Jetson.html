                <h3>Weekday Warrior</h3>
                    <p>
                      With so many places to go, you need a ride reliable enough to get you there, and compact enough to store it with you. The Metro electric folding bicycle is easy wheelin’ to fit your needs. It rides comfortably as a bike with some boost, brings more speed with a twist throttle feature, and folds up easily to be put away wherever you go.
                        </p>
                      <p>
                        But there are upsides too. The whole bike is super lightweight without a bunch of heavy bike components like pedals, cranks, chain, chain ring, cassette, derailleur, etc. Plus, you don’t have to worry about maintaining or adjusting those parts, and there are fewer things to break.

                        And with fewer bike parts, the price of the Jetson Bolt can come down without sacrificing the quality of the electrical components.

            <h3>Features</h3>
                <h4> 3 levels of pedal assist </h4>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      The Metro is all about making things easier for you. Turn it on and choose from 3 levels of pedal assist – level 1 gives you a small boost, and level 3 gives you the biggest. Just decide how easy you want to ride, start pedaling, and feel the motor enhance your power.

                    </p>

                         The bike offers a highly flexible comfortable saddle ideal for all-terrain. The rear 250 W motor doesn’t sound like much, but it has surprisingly good torque. The little motor gets me up to the bike’s top speed of 15 mph (25 km/h) quite quickly. Keep in mind that there are no pedals, so that acceleration is entirely unassisted.

                        <p> The range is rated at 17 miles (30 km), but I got around 2/3 of that before performance started to become sluggish. I’m not sure where they got 17 miles from, unless those are downhill miles. Still, 12 miles or so isn’t bad for this tiny e-bike. Considering it is meant for city riding, I can’t imagine riding much farther than that.
                      </p>
                        <p>  
                        This little e-bike is actually pretty fun to ride. The first day or two I kept blindly feeling for pedals with my feet when I would takeoff. But I soon got used to the whole “no pedals” thing, and it eventually felt normal.

                        With a decently torquey motor and small 12″ diameter wheels, the Jetson Bolt gets up to speed quickly and I never felt like I needed to assist it.

                        The only time I missed having pedals was on hills, where it would slow down a bit.
                        </p>

                <h4> Secure magnetic folding closure </h4>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      The easy folding system and collapsible handlebars make the Metro compact for your needs. And with a built-in magnet to ensure it stays securely folded you’ll never have to worry about popping and unlocking.

                    </p>

                <h4> LCD display</h4>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      A smartly placed LCD display shows you your speed, distance traveled, pedal assist level, and battery life all in a clean, easy-to-read design.
 
                   </p>

                <h4> Concealed removable battery</h4>
                    <p class="subtitle-a">
                      Charge things up when you’re on the go. The Metro features a removable battery hidden in the center frame that locks with a key. Keep it safely stored, or take it out and recharge, worry-free.
                    </p>
