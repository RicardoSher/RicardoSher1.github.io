          <h2>QUIETKAT 750</h2>

          <div class="clearfix">

                  <p>
                    One of the smallest e-bikes currently manufactured by QuietKat, the QuietKat 750 Bandit Folding Frame Electric Bike is an ideal combination of portability and power. With both a folding steering column and a folding frame mechanism, the QuietKat Bandit can be reduced to just a fraction of its original size. Unlike many folding bikes, the QuietKat Bandit folding frame electric bike retains the strength and durability that has become synonymous with the QuietKat range of off-road electric bikes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The QuietKat Ambush 750 LT is built on a solid, one-piece Aluminum frame.  It includes an 8-gear Shimano shifter, mechanical brakes, and has a top speed of 19 mph – although I hit low 20’s during my review.  The bike sports two 26” fat tires that absorb the shock and abuse found on off-road trails.  I tested this bike in mud, sand, and gravel, and it traversed them easily.  The bike contains a small gear motor that sits between the pedals. That motor is powered by a 48v Lithium-Ion battery. The power supplied to that motor is adjustable. Using a convenient power switch on the handlebar, you can set the bike power from 1 to 5, with 5 being the maximum power applied.

            <h3>Easy to Fold</h3>
                  <p>
                    </p>
                   The QuietKat Bandit can be folded down for easy transport in the trunk of a car; then all you need to do is quickly and simply fold the frame and steering column back up to full size, and you’re ready to start riding.

            <h3>Robust Design</h3>
                  <p>
                      Despite the folding frame design, the QuietKat Bandit e-bike is still tough enough to successfully carry a load of up to 300 lbs. This makes the QuietKat Bandit a great choice for those who want to haul cargo, game or tools in and out of inaccessible areas, all while crossing inhospitable terrain.
                  </p>

                </div>


            <h3>Optimum Power</h3>
                          <div class="clearfix">
                 <img src="images/qk1.png" class="float-img">
                        <p>
                         One of the fantastic things about the QuietKat Bandit is that riders don’t have to compromise on power just because it is a folding bike. On the contrary, the QuietKat Bandit electric bike has an impressive 750-watt Bafang mid-drive motor with a 3-speed internal gearing system for maximum efficiency. Connected to a 48 volt, 11.6 amp hour Panasonic lithium battery, this electric motor has the ability to output up to 1.01 mechanical horsepower, a phenomenal effort when compared to the output of most electric bike motors. The motor can be engaged with a Class II throttle for instant power or by selecting one of the levels of PAS (Pedal Assist).
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Prior to my review of the QuietKat Ambush 750 LT (Zion) fat tire bike, I was skeptical of the claims and questioned whether a fat-tire hunting bike was suitable for a 53-year-old whitetail hunter?  Not only has that question been answered, but I would be hard-pressed to find a reason for hunters not to own one.  As I stated in my video review, my fat-tire e-bike will change my whitetail hunting, and perhaps other hunts as well! 

The QuietKat Ambush 750 LT was far more effective than I imagined.  I knew the QuietKat would be high quality and built exceptionally well. What I didn’t expect was how easy it was to use, especially for a middle aged guy who is not in top physical condition.  I was amazed at the performance. I did two 6-mile off road loops and pedaled (maybe) 20 revolutions each ride.  I also didn’t expect to go 18 miles on one single charge - with 30% still left on the battery.

                          The QuietKat Bandit has been outfitted with 20” x 4” fat tires; these extra wide tires make it possible for the QuietKat Bandit to ride across a sandy beach, up a muddy trail and even through snow. The air suspension fork and mechanical disc brakes add to both the comfort and the safety of the QuietKat Bandit folding bike, while the digital display allows you to select a mode and monitor your travel statistics.
                        </p>

                          <p>
                            And with its custom-built, rust-resistant 6061 aluminum alloy frame and rugged construction, the Rambo R1000XP doesn’t disappoint in that regard. The bike was made specifically for tackling extreme trails and has “outdoors” written all over its oh-so-cool Camo-painted finish.

                            The Bike's frame is a 19-inch one, with a stand-over height of 31 inches. It comes fitted with a custom-built 36T Narrow Wide chainring, RST Renegade fork suspension, Promax 770-millimeter handlebar, and a Selle Royal saddle for a smooth and comfortable ride. 

                            And we can’t talk about the frame without taking a moment to discuss the large wheels and extra-wide Maxxis Minion fat tires, too, which measure 26 x 4.8 inches.

                            On a regular electric bike, these fat tires would be overkill, but for off-road, hunting trails, they provide an insane amount of traction. That makes the bike feel a whole lot more safe and stable, even when the actual road conditions are anything but ideal.

                            Another thing that you’ll surely notice is that, at roughly 69 pounds, it’s not exactly the definition of lightweight.

                      <h3>Superb Battery Life</h3>
                           <p>
                          
                          The marketing specification claim that the Ambush 750 LT can go 20 miles on a full charge (10 bars).  On day two of my review, I started with a fully charged battery and spent all day testing and filming. By the time I wrapped up, I had gone 18 miles with 3 bars remaining (30%) on the bike console. So, I believe that the marketing claims are accurate.

                          Full discloser; battery life is tough to predict because conditions can vary widely.  I don’t have many steep trails, and the temperatures were warm when I performed my tests. I would assume that if you were taking the bike up Pike’s Peak in Colorado, the battery discharge rate may be different.

                          A fully drained battery takes 4-6 hours to charge.  The charging can take place on the bike, or you can remove the battery and charge it indoors.  The QuietKat bike includes a charger designed for the 48v battery.
